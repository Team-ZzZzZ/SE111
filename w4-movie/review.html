                <p> <em>Spaceballs</em> is by far one of the funniest movies I have ever watched. If you have ever watched star wars or star treck then you will immediately pick up on most of the jokes shown in the movie. While the movie is mostly a parody, it can take itself seriously when the time is right as it does have an actual plot. Most if not every character is parodying something. Lone Starr is obviously Han Solo, Yogurt is obviously Yoda. There's even a parody version of the force called the "schwartz" with an "up side and a downside" With all the Comedic Gold and a pretty solid plot, I can hapilly say this is my favorite movie. If I had any complaints it would be that the movie wasn't longer as it is a tad short.</p>
